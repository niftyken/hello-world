# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub!

This is my first actual effort to try to get to know GitHub. Back in college, my senior project software team failed to use a version control system, and on the morning of the software faire, having not slept in three days, *someone* on the team accidentally and irrecoverably deleted a critical portion of the code, breaking out entire application. I spent most of the time at the software faire trying to shoo away my friends who came to check out my project, and trying not to die of embarrassment. We had nearly nothing to show at the software faire for our quarter-long softare project. 

This is me now, trying to make up for lost time.
